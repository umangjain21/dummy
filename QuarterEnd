Dear Team,

Today’s my last day at Goldman Sachs, and I just wanted to send a quick note to say thank you!

It’s been a wild ride navigating the world of PURE with all of you. From debugging mysteries to those "aha!" moments when code finally runs – it's been an adventure I won’t forget.

I'm off to write new chapters (in a different language, no less!), but I'll miss the fun we had making PURE do its magic.

Let’s stay in touch, and who knows, maybe our code paths will cross again!

Cheers,

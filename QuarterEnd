An outline (also known as database outline) define the database design in a tree structure which define :

dimension
member
consolidations
formulas and calculations scripts
aliases,
properties,
types,
relationship among Dimensions (Dimension-Member Structure)
mathematical relationships


Dimension:

A dimension represents the highest consolidation level in the database outline. The database outline presents dimensions and members in a tree structure to indicate a hierarchy relationship.

For example, below, Hierarchical Structure:

Year, Accounts, Scenario, Product are a dimension
Qtr1 is a member of the Dimension Year (of type Time)

Dimension contain Member, which you can nest inside of other members in a Hierarchies.

Hierarchies also define the relationship that users see during analytic operations.

Members that consist of other members define consolidations levels in the dimension hierarchy.

Rules Files:

A rules files tells Essbase what changes to make to :

the data source to load
and the outline to build

during :

a data load
or a dimension build.

--
Outline build rules file:

When you create dimension with thousands of member or with many alternate hierarchy, you want to automate the process to add the member.

You use Dimension build rules files to map dimension and member from a data source to an Essbase outline.

During dimension building, the Rules files tells Essbase how to build the hierarchy and how to transform member before loading them.

When you execute a dimension build, Essbase :

reads the member in the data source
change them based on the rules in the rules files
and load the changed member into the outline


DATALOAD:

Data Load Rules file is the type of rules files which is involved in the data load process.

A data source for data load must contain :

not only the values that you want to load
but also identification of the location to which Essbase should load the values: a data address that includes one member from every standard dimension in your outline.
In addition to mapping metadata in data source to your dimension, rules files enable you to transform data upon loading in the following way :

scale data
change the sign of data
Overwrite, add to, or subtract from existing data

Partitions:

Basically Essbase supports 3 types of partitions.

Transparent Partition
Replicated Partition
Linked Partition
 Linked partitions:
Though this is called as a partition technique, it does not provide the generic partitioning capabilities. 
This basically provides a link to other databases (using XREF) and based on the mapping done while creating the partition,
this partition provides the capability to drill from one cell in a source database to another cell in the target database. 

date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
